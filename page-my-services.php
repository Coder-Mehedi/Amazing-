        <h3>Online Marketing Architect Solution</h3>
        <p>Is it making sense that the same team that suppose to execute your marketing tasks will also be the one who creates the plan and making sure they do a good job and stay on track?<br> Not really, right?</p>
        <p>Before I will tell you about my service, I need to share with you two things.</p>
        <p>1) I am not the execution unit. I am not executing your marketing plan. That means I am not going to replace your existing marketing team (Unless you want them replaced or you don't have one. In that case I can recommend on few). I am going to work with them.</p>
        <p>2) I don't believe in branding for small businesses. While a small business spends money on advertising, in return it suppose to make more money then what it spent. The money spent need to be easily tracked from the campaign level and all the way to your bank account.<br> That means that if you spend $100 on a marketing campaign, you must know how many sales you had from this campaign. As you can see I am not using the word leads. I don't care about leads. I care about sales. You spend money and need to be sure you get the money</p>

    </div>
    <div class="txtBox">
        <p>In the past 15 years I have created multiple web design companies that became very successful and were sold to bigger companies. I have over 1000 websites under my belt, including big names such as JVC, T Mobile, Cyndi Lauper and more.<br> My role will be to work with your company and decide why you need a website, what will be the website goal, what will be the business result of each page, etc.</p>
        <p>Once we will come out with all the answers, we will assign a graphic designer that will reflect all your answers with a design. Using colors, fonts, spacing, etc we can tell a story that matches what you want your prospects to feel.<br> Once the graphic design is complete we will continue to the web development. The web development will answer needs as page load speed, ease of use, etc.<br> Once the website development is complete, a 3rd party company will test the website and will make sure that the website is answering all the requirements that were listed.</p>
